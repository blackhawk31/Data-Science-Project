Applying machine learning classifiers(built in python)

We have taken a simple clean data on Predicting the concrete compressive strength.
Firstly, analysing the data then some preprocessing like normalized each column to bring each value between 0-1.
Then applying different machine learning classifiers to create a model on training set.
Comparing the actual values with the predicted values and to check the loss in regression models, we used RMSE(root_mean_square_error).
